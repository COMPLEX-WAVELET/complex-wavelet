This is the repo to implement a scatterring network using dtcwt.

The structure of the project:
1. dtcwt.ipynb - a notebook to demonstrate results
2. dtcwt_scattering/ - a folder with different dtcwt-networks implementations
3. model/ - a folder with different classifiers(models) to configure inside the main dtcwt_classifier.py
4. dtcwt_classifier.py - the main classifier with dtcwt_transform and model selection. Default values: custom dtcwt-transform and svm-classifier.
